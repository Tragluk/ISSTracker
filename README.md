# ISSTracker
A python International Space Station Tracker using JSON

This was a learning project to teach some students how to use JSON resources and plot them using Turtle.  Over time things like classes and pygame and such were added but they are honestly a little unnecessary.  If you want to commit changes so that this works without tying up the system with that sleep call that would also be a great extra.  Also there is a moment when the ISS moves from 180degrees East to 180degrees West that draws a line across the screen.  Easy fix, just need to penup when that movement is done.  As I said, this was a learning project and not a 'finalized' one.  Please add to it whenever you can.
